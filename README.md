Beginning to be interested in Attack Trees


Intent
------

As a product owner,
I want a repeatable process, supported by a tool,
so that I can identify the scope of security work
and prioritise it appropriately.

"some tools that someone could use in five or ten minutes that may not make the analysis perfect but will improve it substantially."

"attack trees can model an adversaryâ€™s behavior with respect to a target, and how an assessment of risk can be performed"
