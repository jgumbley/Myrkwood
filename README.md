Beginning to be interested in Attack Trees


Intent
------

As a product owner,
I want a repeatable process, supported by a tool,
so that I can identify the scope of security work
and prioritise it appropriately.

"a tool that someone could use in five or ten minutes that may not make the analysis perfect but will improve it substantially. models that are simple, informative, and relatively easy to understand."

"attack trees can model an adversaryâ€™s behavior with respect to a target, and how an assessment of risk can be performed"

"The root node represents the main goal of the attack, while the successor nodes represent ways
to reach the main goal."

Protective countermeasures should be applied evenly across the landscape to prevent the attacks that pose
the greatest threat. 

Trees
-----

There is some art to producing them.

There may be some novel threats, perhaps take care to draw that out. Then there is something like a common attack profile for commercial websites, which can be used as a starting point for a threat briefing.

* Steal money
* Steal data
* Steal products and services
* Break stuff
x
* Script kids
* Organised Criminal Gangs
* Insiders

From here start to draw out an attack tree.
